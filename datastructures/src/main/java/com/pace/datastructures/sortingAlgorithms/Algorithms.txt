        ***** SORTING ALGORITHMS *****

Bubble Sort :
    Usage : Used for sorting small data sets and whenever simple sorting is required.
    Time complexity :
        Best case : O(N)
        Worst case : O(N^2)

Insertion Sort :
    Usage : Used whenever it is necessary to sort a partially sorted data.
    Time complexity :
        Best case : O(N)
        Worst case : O(N^2)

Selection Sort :
    Usage : Used whenever it is necessary to sort a small data sets.
            Used in Embedded systems where low memory usage is preferred than time complexity.
    Time complexity :
        Average : O(N^2)

Quick Sort :
    Usage : Used whenever it is necessary to sort large data sets.
    Time complexity :
        Average/Best case : O(N*log N)
        Worst case : O(N^2)

Merge Sort :
    Usage : Used whenever it is necessary to sort large data sets and parallel sorting is required.
    Procedure :
        1.Sort the left half of the array (recursively)
        2.Sort the right half of the array (recursively)
        3.Merge the solutions
    Time complexity :
        Best case : O(N*log N)
        Worst case : O(N*log N)


        ****** SEARCHING ALGORITHMS ******


Linear Search :
    Usage : Used for searching a small and unsorted set of data which will not increase in size by much.
    Time complexity :
        Average : O(N)

Binary Search :
    Usage : Used in many data structures where sorted data is stored. It requires the array to be sorted in ascending or descending order
    Time complexity :
        Average : O(log(N))
